1. Document Processing Service
- Handles PDF, DOCX, and TXT file ingestion
- Extracts text and metadata using OCR for scanned documents
- Supports batch processing for large document collections
- Processing capacity: 1000 documents/hour

2. Embedding Generation Service
- Uses Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for text embeddings
- Generates 384-dimensional vectors for document chunks
- Supports multiple languages (English, German, French, Spanish)
- Processing speed: 10,000 chunks/minute

3. Vector Search Engine
- FAISS index for similarity search
- Supports both exact and approximate nearest neighbor search
- Index size: Up to 10M documents
- Query latency: <50ms for typical searches

4. LLM Integration
- Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet for question answering
- Context window: 200K tokens
- Response generation: <3 seconds
- Supports conversation history
